## Nielsen‚Äôs 10 Usability Heuristics Compliance

1. **Visibility of System Status**  
   - Animated loading (‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù) and button hover effects provide instant feedback.  
   - Active navigation link underlines show the current page.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World**  
   - Clear, human-readable labels (Home, Education, Work, etc.) mirror real-world concepts.  
   - Icons (üéì, üíº, ü§ù) reinforce meaning.

3. **User Control and Freedom**  
   - ‚ÄúDownload Resume‚Äù button is always available in the navbar.  
   - Persistent navigation lets users jump between pages without dead ends.

4. **Consistency and Standards**  
   - Uniform layout structure, typography, and color palette across all pages.  
   - Standard link hover/active states and button behaviors.

5. **Error Prevention**  
   - External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent tab-nabbing.  
   - All links and assets are validated before deployment.

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**  
   - Persistent navbar and footer present context on every page.  
   - Clear section headings and icons minimize cognitive load.

7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**  
   - Responsive design adapts to mobile and desktop automatically.  
   - External CSS per page keeps payload small and speeds up loading.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**  
   - Dark theme with high-contrast text for readability.  
   - Clean layouts without unnecessary decoration; focus on content.

9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**  
   - Missing images display descriptive alt text rather than broken icons.  
   - Can add a custom 404 page to redirect users back to Home.

10. **Help and Documentation**  
    - This README provides clear setup, structure, and design rationale.  
    - Alt text and PR history document changes for future maintainers.
